The determinant formula for the Casimir energy in terms of boundary layer operators provides a good and accurate approach to its numerical computation.
We have demonstrated that modern methods from computational linear algebra combined with the idea of subspace recycling can provide a significant 
speedup and accuracy boost in computations of Casimir forces and energies.
