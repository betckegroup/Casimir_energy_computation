We have demonstrated in this paper the practical performance and error behaviour for computing the Casimir energy for a number of different configurations, using the log determinant approach. A remaining problem is to speed up this method for large-scale configurations. Here, we demonstrated the performance of different Krylov subspace methods, demonstrating that together with recycling tricks we can significantly reduce the computational effort for large problems.

While we have demonstrated the results in this paper for the acoustic case, the prinicple techniques also transfer to the electromagnetic case. We aim to report corresponding results in future publications.
