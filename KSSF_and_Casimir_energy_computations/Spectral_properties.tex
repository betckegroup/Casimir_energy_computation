{\color {blue} The matrix $M_{\infty}$ is a compact perturbation of matrix $M$, which makes the eigenvalues of them close to each other. Therefore, if we plot the eigenvalues of 
the matrix $MM_{\infty}^{-1}$, we can notice that there are many eigenvalues closed to 1 and nearly contributes nothing to the log determinant. This spectral property
inspires us to use some iteration method to approximate the extreme eigenvalues of $MM_{\infty}^{-1}$. In order to make the computation process more efficiently, 
we will introduce an inverse-free method to speed up this process which makes us deal with the large-scale problem in the future.}
