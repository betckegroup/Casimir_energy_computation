\subsection{Two-spheres case}
{\color {blue} The scatterers are two spheres and we compute the Casimir energy between them with the centering distance $Z = 2.5, 3.5, 5$ in the scalar and 
vector case; we also have the asymptotic series in the scalar and vector cases. Finally, we compare the results obtained from different 
methods.} 
\subsection{Realistic objects case}
{\color {blue} The scatterers are set as some realistic objects (or something complex such as 8-branch ice crystal) and we compute the Casimir energy between them 
in the scalar and vector case. Finally, we compare the results obtained from different methods.}
