In this section, we are going to compute the Casimir energy between two perfectly conducting objects, which are spheres, merger-sponges, ice crystals and 
ellipsoids. The reference value of the Casimir energy is computed by the Richardson extrapolation method which is often used 
for obtaining the higher-order estimate at zero grid spacing. We denote $\mathcal{E}_{\text{fine}}$ and $\mathcal{E}_{\text{coarse}}$ as the Casimir energy 
numerically computed by \eqref{KSSF and CasE} when the grid size $h$ is set as $h_{\text{fine}}$ and $h_{\text{coarse}}$ ($h_{\text{fine}}<h_{\text{coarse}}$), separately. Then the high-accuracy 
result $\mathcal{E}_{\text{exact}}$ can be generated from the following formula:
\begin{align}\label{Richardson extrapolation}
    \mathcal{E}_{\text{exact}} \approx \mathcal{E}_{\text{fine}} + \frac{h_{\text{coarse}}^{2}\mathcal{E}_{\text{fine}} - h_{\text{fine}}^{2}\mathcal{E}_{\text{coarse}}}{h_{\text{coarse}}^{2} - h_{\text{fine}}^{2}}.
\end{align}
In addition, the asymptotic series of the Casimir energy are also available in two spheres' case and the series can be found in \cite{emig2008casimir} 
for both equal and unequal radii's cases. 

\subsection{Two spheres case}

    \caption{Two spheres with equal radii: $R$ represents the radius of the spheres and $Z$ is the distance between them.}
    \label{Two spheres with equal radii}
\end{figure}

Consider two perfectly conducting spheres with equal radii, which is shown in the Figure \ref{Two spheres with equal radii}. Inside the figure, $R$ is the radius 
of the spheres and the distance between them is denoted as $Z$. We firstly estimate the Casimir energy between the spheres with radius $R = 1$ and distance $Z$ 
ranging from 0.5 to 3.0 by using the equation \eqref{KSSF and CasE} with grid size set as $h_{\text{fine}} = 0.05$ and $h_{\text{coarse}} = 0.1$. Afterwards,
the extrapolation result can be obtained by substituting these Casimir energy estimates into the formula \eqref{Richardson extrapolation}. This result would be 
regarded as the exact value of the Casimir energy and be used to compare with the estimates derived from the asymptotic series introduced below. 

According to \cite{emig2008casimir}, the Casimir energy between these spheres (with equal radii $R$) at asymptotically 
large separations can be obtained as a series in terms of the ratio of centre distance $L$ ($L = 2R + Z$) to sphere radius $R$:
\begin{align}\label{Asymptotic equal radii}
   \mathcal{E} = -\frac{\hbar c}{\pi}\frac{1}{L}\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}b_{n}\left(\frac{R}{L}\right)^{n+2},
\end{align}
where the first six coefficients are 
$b_{0} = -1/4$, $b_{1} = -1/4$,  $b_{2} = -77/48$,  $b_{3} = -25/16$,  $b_{4} = -29837/2880$, $b_{5} = -6491/1152$. The value of Casimir energy computed from the 
asymptotic series \eqref{Asymptotic equal radii} is compared with the exact value evaluated through \eqref{KSSF and CasE} in Figure 
\ref{Casimir energy between spheres with equal radii}. In this figure, the asymptotic value gradually approaches to the exact value as the distance between the 
spheres increases since the asymptotic expansion \eqref{Asymptotic equal radii} only works when the distance between two spheres is asymptotically large.

\end{figure}
\footnotetext{The normalized Casimir energy is $\mathcal{E}/\hbar c$, for $\mathcal{E}$ defined in \eqref{KSSF and CasE}.}

Afterwards, in order to test the performance of the two efficient methods introduced in Section \ref{Krylov subspace for generalized eigenvalue problem}, we
would use them to evaluate the Casimir energy between two spheres described above. For the inverse-free Krylov subspace method, the dimension of the Krylov subspace is set as $m = 20$ and 50 and the 
number of approximated smallest (or largest) eigenvalues is $p = 10$ and 25, respectively. For the standard Arnoldi method, the dimension of the 
Krylov subspace is also set as $m = 20$ and 50. In Figure \ref{equal_radii_rel_dist}, we can easily find the inverse-free Krylov subspace method behaves better 
than the standard Arnoldi method no matter when the dimension $m$ is 20 or 50 and as we increase the Krylov subspace dimension, the relative distance decreases.
In addition, it can be noticed that when the distance $Z$ between the spheres increases, the relative error 
for both methods goes down. The reason is when the spheres are getting away from each other, the cross interaction between them becomes weaker and the compact 
perturbation $\tilde{\mathsf{V}}_{k}$ becomes close to $\mathsf{V}_{k}$, which implies the number of the eigenvalues that mainly contribute on the log 
determinant of $\mathsf{V}_{k}\tilde{\mathsf{V}}_{k}^{-1}$ decreases. Therefore, if we keep setting the same dimension of Krylov subspace when the spheres
are at a large distance, we would have a better approximation on the Casimir energy.

    Krylov subspace method, the number of the approximated smallest (or largest) eigenvalues is set as $p = 10$ and 25, respectively.}

\end{figure}

When the perfectly conducting spheres have different radii (see Figure \ref{Two spheres with unequal radii}), $R_{1}$ and $R_{2}$ and the centre distance 
is $L = 2R+Z$, the asymptotic expansion of the Casimir energy at asymptotically large distance can be written as:
\begin{align}\label{Asymptotic unequal radii}
    \mathcal{E} = -\frac{\hbar c}{\pi}\frac{1}{L}\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\tilde{b}_{n}(\eta)\left(\frac{R_{1}}{L}\right)^{n+2},
\end{align}
where the coefficients $\{\tilde{b}_{n}\}$ depend on the parameter $\eta = R_{2}/R_{1}$ and the first six coefficients are
\begin{align*}
    \tilde{b}_{0} &= -\frac{\eta}{4}, \ \ \ \ \ \tilde{b}_{1} = -\frac{\eta + \eta^{2}}{8}, \ \ \ \ \  \tilde{b}_{2} = -\frac{34(\eta+\eta^{3})+ 9\eta^{2}}{48}, \ \ \ \ \ \tilde{b}_{3} = -\frac{2(\eta+\eta^{4}) + 23(\eta^{2} + \eta^{3})}{32}, \\ 
    \tilde{b}_{4} &= -\frac{8352(\eta + \eta^{5})+ 1995(\eta^{2} + \eta^{4}) + 38980\eta^{3}}{5760}, \ \ \ \ \ \tilde{b}_{5} = -\frac{-1344(\eta+\eta^{6}) + 5478(\eta^{2} + \eta^{5})+2357(\eta^{3} + \eta^{4})}{2304}.
\end{align*}

In the following experiment, the radii of the spheres shown in Figure \ref{Two spheres with unequal radii} are set as $R_{1} = 0.5, R_{2} = 1$. (Continue to write)
